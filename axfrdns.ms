axfrdns - a DNS zone transfer server.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP 5
\fBaxfrdns\fR [OPTIONS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBaxfrdns\fR is a zone transfer server.  It reads a zone transfer request in
DNS-over-TCP format from its standard input and responds with a locally
configured information. \fBaxfrdns\fR looks up zone-transfer results in
data.cdb, a binary file created by tinydns-data(1). It also responds to normal
client queries such as SOA queries, which usually precede zone transfer
requests.

\fBaxfrdns\fR allows zone transfer for any zone listed in the $AXFR variable.
AXFR is a slash separated list of domain names. If AXFR is not set,
\fBaxfrdns\fR allows zone transfer for all zone available in data.cdb.

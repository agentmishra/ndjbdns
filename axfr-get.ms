axfr-get - a DNS zone transfer client.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP 5
\fBaxfr-get\fR [OPTIONS] <DOMAIN-NAME> <OUTFILE> <OUTFILE.TMP>

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBaxfr-get\fR is a DNS zone transfer client. It sends a zone transfer request
in DNS-over-TCP format to descriptor 7, reads the result from descriptor 6 and
saves the result in a file.

\fBaxfr-get\fR performs the zone transfer for the given domain, and writes the
result to file - OUTFILE.TMP in a format that can be used as input to
tinydns-data(1). If the zone transfer completes successfully, axfr-get
renames OUTFILE.TMP to OUTFILE.

.SH NAME
\fBtinydns\fR - DNS server.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtinydns\fR [\fBOPTIONS\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBtinydns\fR is a DNS server that answers DNS queries from other hosts with
locally configured information. When invoked, \fBtinydns\fR reads from the
configuration file and listens on UDP port 53 for the incoming requests. When
a request is received, \fBtinydns\fR answers it by looking into `data.cdb'
file placed under the ROOT directory specified in the configuration file.

Until version 1.05.8, \fBtinydns\fR used to read from `data.cdb' for each
request it received and responded to. In version 1.05.9, \fBtinydns\fR read
`data.cdb' ones at the beginning and later when signalled for the same via
SIGUSR1. From version 1.06, \fBtinydns\fR reads `data.cdb' every 5 seconds and
thus does not need to be signalled via SIGUSR1.

New-DJBDNS
==========

.LP
Hello all,

.PP
I am pleased to release this *new* djbdns version 1.06. Djbdns is a
fully-fledged Domain Name System(DNS), originally written by the eminent
author of qmail, Dr. D J Bernstein. This new release is a complete makeover
to the original source(djbdns-1.05) and is meant to make life a lot more
pleasant. The original source is in public-domain since late Dec 2007.

Nevertheless, this new release is distributed under the GNU General Public
Licence for good. See ChangeLog for more details.

Installation:
.br
-------------
.sp
To install djbdns, say:
.DS I
sh>$ ./configure [ --prefix=/usr/local ]
sh>$ make
sh># make install
.DE

Once installed, On Linux machines add `dnscache' to the system services
by following steps. Note that, if you chose a different install prefix with
`--prefix', use that instead of the default - /usr/local.
.DS I
sh># mv /usr/local/bin/dnscached /etc/init.d/dnscached
sh># chkconfig --add dnscached
sh># chkconfig --list dnscached
.DE

Now you can start the service by

.DS I
sh># service dnscached start
         OR
sh># dnscache -D
.DE

Consult the dnscache(8) manual page for more help.
